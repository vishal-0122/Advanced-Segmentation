Advanced Segmentation: Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing

Project Overview: Advanced Segmentation is a machine learning project aimed at segmenting customers based on their key characteristics such as salary, age, gender, and spending capacity. The project applies clustering algorithms to group customers into distinct segments, enabling businesses to target specific customer groups with tailored marketing strategies. This information is then provided to marketing agencies to facilitate more effective and focused marketing campaigns.

Objectives:
To apply clustering techniques to segment customers based on their demographics and spending behavior.
To identify meaningful customer segments that can be targeted for specific marketing efforts.
To provide actionable insights to marketing agencies for designing personalized marketing campaigns.

Methodology:
Data Preprocessing: The customer data, including salary, age, gender, and spending capacity, is cleaned and normalized for accurate clustering.
Clustering Algorithms: Several clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) are applied to group customers into clusters based on the similarities in their features.
Cluster Analysis: After segmentation, the clusters are analyzed to identify patterns and characteristics that define each customer segment.
Targeted Marketing: The customer segments are then shared with marketing agencies, helping them design campaigns that are more likely to resonate with each group.

Results: The project provides valuable insights into customer behavior and helps businesses create more personalized marketing strategies, resulting in more effective targeting and better customer engagement.
